# 👋 Hi, I'm Yair Etziony

I'm a Berlin-based Engineering Manager & Electronic Music Producer with 30+ years of experience spanning systems administration, DevOps, and infrastructure. I build tools and systems that solve complex operational challenges at scale, while also creating experimental electronic music that explores the intersection of technology and emotion.
