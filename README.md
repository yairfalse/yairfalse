Yair Etziony,

30 years of infra, from VAX/VMS to the cloud. Now building K8s tools in Rust & Elixir. Anti-YAML.

## Key Projects

### [Sykli](https://github.com/yairfalse/sykli)
CI without the YAML. Write your pipelines in real programming languages.
Local-first: use your own CPUs before paying for cloud. Your CI config should be testable, type-checked, and debuggable like any other code. Built on Elixir and the BEAM for natural concurrency.

### [Kulta](https://github.com/yairfalse/kulta)
Kubernetes Progressive Delivery Controller, designed to work with the new K8s API-Gateway, simple, no need for service mesh, easy observability with CDEvents, Prometheus metrics

### [Rauta](https://github.com/yairfalse/rauta)
Kubernetes-native API Gateway, easy to understand, maintain, and configure, cloud-native architecture with Kubernetes integration, currently in active development

## Electronic Music

I create experimental electronic music as **[ENXIO](https://yairetziony.bandcamp.com/)** - ambient/industrial compositions exploring the intersection of technology and emotion.

- 15+ albums since 2007
- Tech-themed releases: "Git remote rm main", "Kubectl delete pod"
- Modular synthesizer & Max/MSP compositions
