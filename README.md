Yair Etziony
Engineering Manager living in Berlin. 30 years of building infrastructure, from VAX/VMS to eBPF.
I think most infrastructure tooling optimizes for the wrong things — flexibility over clarity, features over ergonomics. I build tools that are easy to understand first.

## Key Projects

### [sykli](https://github.com/yairfalse/tapio)
**CI without the YAML, Write your pipelines in real programming languages**
CI without the YAML. Write your pipelines in real programming languages.
Local-first: use your own CPUs before paying for cloud. Your CI config should be testable, type-checked, and debuggable like any other code. Built on Elixir and the BEAM for natural concurrency.

### [Kulta](https://github.com/yairfalse/kulta)
**Kubernetes Progressive Delivery Controller**
Designed to work with the new K8s API-Gateway, simple, no need for service mesh, easy observability with CDEvents, Prometheus metrics

### [Rauta](https://github.com/yairfalse/rauta)
**Kubernetes-native API Gateway**
Easy to understand, maintain, and configure, cloud-native architecture with Kubernetes integration, currently in active development

## Electronic Music

I create experimental electronic music as **[ENXIO](https://yairetziony.bandcamp.com/)** - ambient/industrial compositions exploring the intersection of technology and emotion.

- 15+ albums since 2007
- Tech-themed releases: "Git remote rm main", "Kubectl delete pod"
- Modular synthesizer & Max/MSP compositions
